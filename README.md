## Functional and non-functional requirements documentby 14/03/2022 (changed to 11/04/2022)
• Gathered and summarised


## Data preparation (by 11/04/2022)
• Gather general statistics about the provided convictions time-series

• Identify any potential problems with data, filter outliers etc.

• Prepare a master index of stock symbols and retrieve corresponding price
data for each symbol (sources, e.g. Yahoo Finance or Google)


## Implement a simple analysis harness that (by 28/03/2022) (changed to 11/04/2022)
• a) splits data into training and test sets,

• b) trains a dummy model,

• c) performs a cross-validation and

• d) generate stats in a form of a pdf report.

## Initial modelling (11/04/2022)
• Implement a simple regression model to be used as a baseline for further
analysis

• Train, test and cross-validate the regression model and show that the model
generalizes on the out-of-sample data


## Advanced modelling (by 30/05/2022)
• Develop, train, test and cross-validate three alternative models

• Compare performance of the models against a baseline model and against
each other for the various investment horizons

• Perform stability and sensitivity analysis w.r.t baseline model and investment
horizons
